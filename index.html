                    I'm Affan Malik, a motivated and dedicated Computer Science student with a passion for software development.
                    Throughout my academic journey, I've been fortunate to gain a deep understanding of various computer science disciplines, including advanced data structures, algorithms, secure web applications, data science, and project management. My minor in Cybersecurity through the ACES program has equipped me with the knowledge and skills to tackle emerging security challenges in the digital landscape.
                    My professional journey started with a Software Engineering Internship at UPS, where I had the privilege of working on impactful projects. I developed a C# program that significantly reduced debugging time and modernized a package shipping interpreter, making it more efficient for vendors worldwide. Additionally, I enhanced the accessibility of UPS.com help files through HTML parsing.
                    As an Instructional Intern at Nobel Explorers Learning, I had the opportunity to instruct and mentor aspiring programmers and web designers. I created a curriculum that allowed students to code an adventure game in Python, fostering a collaborative and engaging learning environment.
                    In my spare time, I enjoy working on personal projects, such as a Movie Reviewing web application, where I developed a full-stack social media platform for movie enthusiasts. I utilized technologies like React.js, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs to create an intuitive and dynamic user experience.
                    My technical skillset spans various programming languages, including Java, Python, C#, and more. I'm well-versed in frameworks like .NET, Flask, React.js, and Node.js, and I'm proficient in developer tools such as Git and Visual Studio.
